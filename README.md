Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone represents the final (10th) course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It serves as a comprehensive project that integrates and demonstrates the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program.

Project Background
SpaceX is currently the leading company in the commercial space industry, known for making space travel more cost-effective. The company promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of approximately 62 million dollars, compared to over 165 million dollars by other providers. A significant portion of this cost efficiency is attributed to the reusability of the rocket's first stage. If it is possible to predict whether the first stage will land successfully, the cost of a launch can also be estimated. This project leverages publicly available data and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage.

Research Questions
How do factors such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type influence the success of the first stage landing?

Has the success rate of first stage landings improved over time?

Which machine learning algorithm performs best for binary classification in this scenario?
